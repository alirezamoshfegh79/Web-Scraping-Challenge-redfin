# Web-Scraping-Challenge-redfin
This Python script uses Selenium to automate searching for a user-specified city on Redfin, navigates to its housing market page, and then extracts the median home sale price data via regex from the pageâ€™s script tags. Finally, it saves the scraped data to a JSON file for further analysis.
